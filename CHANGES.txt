Changelog
=========

1.0b5 - 2010-05-03
------------------

- Show current page in breadcrumbs, give the surrounding div the same height
  as our portal-headers for consistency.
  [esteele]

- Dtml vars removed.
  Fixes: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10492
  [pelle]

- Improved :focus which is an accessibility requirement, a level 2 priority 
  point/AA. This was removed entirely due to the reset css in use, so 
  specifying :hover then remember :focus as well.
  Fixes: http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10472
  [pelle]

- Fix for global navigation colliding with portlets, bread crumb etc. 
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10491
  [pelle]

1.0b4 - 2010-05-01
------------------

- Always enable breadcrumbs on all levels. ploneCustom contains an example on
  how to disable them on the first levels. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9987 again.
  [elvix, hannosch]

- Added tests for "ajax_load" query string in main_template. When found, skip
  anything expensive that isn't going to show in an ajax overlay.
  The plone.app.jquerytools overlay helper sets the ajax_load query string
  to prevent browser caching.
  [smcmahon]

- Removed fixed vertical position for overlays. This needs to be computed on
  display so that overlays don't display out of the viewport on long pages.
  [smcmahon]

- Remove display:none for navigation portlet header. This is now handled
  through the template.
  [esteele]

- Improved style of blocked portlets.
  [igbun]

- Be carefull with adding ie hacks to IEFixes.css since Sunburst Theme 
  uses IE8.js.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10417.
  [pelle]

- Improved overlay styling e.g. for openid overlay.
  Done when stepping trough #10035 and it's tried to make as general as possible.
  [pelle]


1.0b3 - 2010-04-10
------------------

- Improved mobile styling.
  [limi]

- Less disruptive styling for inline validation, it no longer shifts the form
  around in a significant way.
  [limi]

- Remove unused personalize_form template and unneeded copies of the author
  template and prefs_main_template.
  [davisagli]

- Updated styling for breadcrumbs, tags/keywords, and added styles for the
  currently selected nav tree item.
  [limi]

- Adjusted viewlets so that Sunburst uses the viewlet configuration from
  plone.app.layout.viewlets.
  [davisagli]

- Improved call-out and pull-quote styling.
  [limi]

- Improved general overlay styling.
  [limi]

- Improved history pop-up styling.
  [limi]

- Fix columns in prefs_main_template.
  [davisagli]

  the @@plone view and it has different portlets (such as on the portlet
  management views).  This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10320.
  [davisagli]

- Repositioned the searchbox for RTL scripts.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10367.

  [dukebody]

  [vincentfretin]

1.0b2 - 2010-03-05
------------------

- Established Sunburst-specific browser view similar to ploneview and moved
  out the logic of applying special width/position CSS class on
  #portal-column-content from main_template.pt to that view.
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10292
  [spliter]

- Set up testing environment for the package
  [spliter]

- Inline images should not have borders (makes it hard to insert graphics that
  are part of a sentence, or similar), and we don't have any other round
  elements in the basic design (the edit bar is special, and is round to
  differentiate itself from the "stable elements"), so removed the rounded
  corners for image frames.
  [limi]

- Added some padding to a <fieldset> in order to have better-looking forms.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9824
  [spliter]

- Moved language selector and personal tools viewlets into plone.portalheader
  viewlet manager and re-positioned them relatively instead of absolute.
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10252
  [spliter]

- Hide the "up to groups overview" link and fieldset border in the "add group"
  overlay. 
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10149
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10150
  [stuttle]

- Replaced references to redundant #region-content to #content in stylesheets.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10231
  [spliter]

- Adding back IE8.js to fix Sunburst for IE6/7, re-enabling mobile device
  support.
  [limi]

- Adding IE8.js v2.1 beta, this should resolve the issues with @media selectors,
  and let us re-enable the mobile support again. Thanks to Dean Edwards for
  fixing this.
  [limi]

1.0b1 - 2010-02-18

  redundant. See http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10231 for details.

  conventions.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
  [spliter]
  
- Moved 'content' slot to the same place as it is in CMFPlone's
  main_template.pt. Having the same slot in different places is confusing.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981

  author.pt.
