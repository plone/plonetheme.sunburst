  [rossp]


1.0.3 - 2010-09-09

- Removed padding from navigation portlet header when it is hidden, so we won't
  see a small chunk of it. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10800.
  [cwainwright]

- Worked on fixing up styles for IE8:

  * put previous logo settings back (float messes with rtl)
  * put in IE spacing fixes (logo, hiddenStructure)
  * removed float from div.cell, so livesearch and display menu don't fall
    behind other items in IE8.

  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10872.
  [cwainwright]

- Removed "line-height: 2em;" from "table.listing a" css rule so the vertical
  alignment of linked text and non linked text is the same.

- Moved icons in drop down "Add new..." menu to right of text for RTL
  scripts. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10954.

- Worked on fixing up styles for IE7:

    displays on one level
  * put in hack to make links with content icons 'display: block' in IE.
    This fixes the Add New dropdown display, but breaks icon display on
    .navTreeCurrentItem, so I added zoom to the links.
    (fyi - the hack was the only way I could find to make this work to
    override the inline-block, did not work in IEFixes.css)
  * adjusted styles on logo so IE displays it in the correct place

  how to disable them on the first levels. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9987 again.
  [elvix, hannosch]

- Added tests for "ajax_load" query string in main_template. When found, skip
  anything expensive that isn't going to show in an ajax overlay.
  The plone.app.jquerytools overlay helper sets the ajax_load query string
  to prevent browser caching.
  [smcmahon]

- Removed fixed vertical position for overlays. This needs to be computed on

  [davisagli]

------------------

  out the logic of applying special width/position CSS class on
  #portal-column-content from main_template.pt to that view.
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10292
  [spliter]

- Set up testing environment for the package
  [spliter]

- Inline images should not have borders (makes it hard to insert graphics that
  are part of a sentence, or similar), and we don't have any other round
  elements in the basic design (the edit bar is special, and is round to
  differentiate itself from the "stable elements"), so removed the rounded
  corners for image frames.
  [limi]

- Added some padding to a <fieldset> in order to have better-looking forms.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9824
  [spliter]

  viewlet manager and re-positioned them relatively instead of absolute.

  support.

- Adding IE8.js v2.1 beta, this should resolve the issues with @media selectors,
  and let us re-enable the mobile support again. Thanks to Dean Edwards for
  fixing this.
  [limi]

  conventions.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
