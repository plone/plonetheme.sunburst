Remaining/known issues:

- Look in main_template for TODO markers; I'm hoping we can simplify or remove
  some of the more complex TAL expressions, or move them to views. 
  Help appreciated. :)

- Add support for the jQuery Tools dialog for deletion — both from the actions 
  menu and from folder_contents

- Figure out whether we can get rid of the prefs_main_template now; having a
  special main_template just for the pref panels shouldn't be necessary.

- Move code to views where possible, and move the KSS spinner to a viewlet or
  something.

- Fix formlib forms to insert a div with class="formControls" on its submit
  buttons.

- Theme is not split up in multiple files yet — we'll probably do a simple 
  public/edit interface split to encourage reuse, but not as many files as Plone 
  3.

- Personal bar is missing Profile link, prefs should link directly to the
  preferences, not to the intermediate page.

- The searchField/inputLabel JS should apply the type="search" dynamically using
  Martijn's script for this.

- The sortableTable script should insert the utf-8 characters for up/down
  instead of using images.

- Remove the "Subfolder" tab from Collections, "Contents" does the same thing.

- Profile and dashboard pages are not styled yet, need to see if we can make
  these use the standard templates.


Need more testing:

- IE6/7 should be functional now, but I haven't tested this personally yet — I
  trust Denys on these things, though. :)

- Limited RTL testing/updates done, need more eyes on this.
